"""Prompt router — splits a user query into concrete SAM targets and semantic reasoning questions.

VisionBrain uses two types of AI models with different capabilities:
- SAM 3.1: handles concrete, segmentable objects (cow, sheep, fence, roof, building).
  It cannot reason about abstract concepts like "damage", "opportunity", or "condition".
- Falcon Perception + Gemma 4: reason about semantics — what the detections mean,
  whether something is damaged, what action to take.

This module routes a user query to the appropriate model(s) by splitting it into:
  - segment_targets: concrete nouns SAM can find and track
  - semantic_query: the abstract question Falcon/Gemma should answer

Example:
    route("cattle with lameness in the south field")
    -> PromptResult(
        segment_targets=["cattle"],
        semantic_query="lameness in the south field"
    )
    route("sheep showing signs of distress near the water trough")
    -> PromptResult(
        segment_targets=["sheep"],
        semantic_query="signs of distress near the water trough"
    )
